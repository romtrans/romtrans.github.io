    <h2>chFile hex editor app on windows</h2>
    <p>This is one of my first projects that I published for free for everyone. It was developed out of my personal interest in retro game translation. It was created using Delphi and Object Pascal. I'm proud that I implemented a relative search method and dynamic character table definitions. It was my first big project.</p>
